# DryerKnob
STL for GE Dryer Knob

I accidentally broke the knob on my parent's drying machine and I had to fix it before they got home. I looked online but I couldn't find any CAD drawings to fit our dryer so I had to design one quickly. I was in a hurry and printed it in red so they quickly noticed my mistake. We are still using it 3 years later. I was then able to scale this down and print one for the AC unit that had a broken knob from years ago. We had pliers to turn it on and off, so this was a much better solution. This is one of the only productive things I have made from my printer.Â
